title: "Asteroids++"

Remember [Asteroids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asteroids_%28video_game%29), the one all the cool kids used to play with? The original, released by Atari in 1979, was implemented by Rains, Logg, and Walsh on hardware developed by Delman and was a vector game, in which the graphics were composed of lines drawn on a vector monitor.

[This](https://github.com/MatteoGiorgi/asteroids_plus_plus) one is a replica (with few additions) and it is written in JavaScript using P5.js[^1] libraries; feel free to play using `w`, `a`, `d` to move around and `spc`, `m` to fire and drop bombs. [Enjoy](https://matteogiorgi.github.io/asteroids_plus_plus/src)!

[^1]: I really do not like JavaScript but P5.js has well made site, good documentation and even an online editor. Give it a chance: [click-clack](https://p5js.org/).
