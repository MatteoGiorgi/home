Haven't you notice some funny comics here and there through these pages? You certainly have and they're hilarious, aren't they? Well, unfortunately they're not my own work but I suggest you take a peek at the (in)famously classic [The UNIX-HATERS handbook](https://web.mit.edu/~simsong/www/ugh.pdf) from 1994 by Garfinkel, Weise and Strassmann.
