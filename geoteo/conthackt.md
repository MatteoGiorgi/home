# ContHackT 2021

At the end of october 2021 [UniPi](https://www.unipi.it/), together with [CLab Pisa](http://contaminationlab.unipi.it/), organized an [hackathon](https://www.unipi.it/index.php/component/k2/item/22305-la-sfida-degli-studenti-unipi-per-lo-sviluppo-sostenibile-si-conclude-con-quattro-idee-vincitrici?Itemid=637) with the goal to promote entrepreneurial culture and innovation, enhancing ideas in an interdisciplinarity environment.

The target was to sharpen the skills of young potential entrepreneurs, allowing participants from different disciplinary fields to know each other and work together on common projects.

> Well, we won. Our team **Teambale** won the first challenge regarding digital and collaborative solutions for transparency and efficiency of the food supply chain.
>
> Consider our computer science nature (at least most of us almost are) and taken we are very curious about blockchain technology, our idea propose to build a system based on a distributed database that would enhance food supply chain transparency and efficiency.

First prize was the access to *EUAcceL*: an event financed by the European Commission and promoted by the European Institute of Innovation and Technology; plus in january we are going to attend a master at Contamination Lab were hopefully we will take our project to the next level.

Sure, we still are in an embryonic stage, but we love to work together discussing new ideas every day. I am confident we will pull something out all of this: the moral is up high and the future looks promising.
