# ContHackT 2021

At the end of october 2021 UniPi, together with [CLab](https://contaminationlab.unipi.it/) Pisa, organized an [hackathon](http://contaminationlab.unipi.it/conthackt-foodmobilitydigital/) with the goal to promote entrepreneurial culture and innovation, enhancing ideas in an interdisciplinarity environment.

The target was to sharpen the skills of young potential entrepreneurs, allowing participants from different disciplinary fields to know each other and work together on common projects.

> Well, among all, [I won the first challenge](http://contaminationlab.unipi.it/conthackt-la-sfida-degli-studenti-unipi-per-lo-sviluppo-sostenibile-si-conclude-con-quattro-idee-vincitrici/) regarding digital and collaborative solutions for transparency and efficiency of the food supply chain.

> Consider my computer science nature and taken I am very curious about blockchain technology, my idea propose to build a system based on a distributed database platform that would enhance food supply chain transparency and efficiency.

First prize was the access to [EUAcceL](https://eit-hei.eu/assets/pdf/fact-sheets/EIT-Project-Fact-Sheet-EUAcceL.pdf), an event financed by the European Commission and promoted by the European Institute of Innovation and Technology; plus in january I am going to attend a master at Contamination Lab were hopefully I will take the project to the next level.
