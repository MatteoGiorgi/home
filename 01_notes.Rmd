title: "Computability notes"
---




I know there is a vast bibliography on the subject but I just wanted to write something intuitive and easy to read on such essential and extensive topic for a computer scientist.

The [notes](https://github.com/MatteoGiorgi/computability_notes) are written in italian and follow professor [P. Degano](http://pages.di.unipi.it/degano/) lectures at [B.Sc. Computer Science](https://didattica.di.unipi.it/en/undergraduate-programme-in-computer-science/) University of Pisa. The source code can be compiled using R with Rmarkdown[^1] package, just use this tiny bash script below.

```{bash eval=FALSE}
echo "require(rmarkdown); render('$1')" | R --vanilla
```
