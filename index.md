# char** main( ._.)

And Crispin Crispian shall ne'er go by,
From this day to the ending of the world,
But we in it shall be remember'd;
We few, we happy few, we band of brothers;
For he to-day that sheds his blood with me
Shall be my brother




## My Linux config

I recently switched to [Qtile](http://www.qtile.org/) from good old [i3](https://i3wm.org/) and I felt right at home. Qtile has its source code and config file written in python, plus a neat [documentation](http://docs.qtile.org/en/latest) comes in support if you fancy to play with it.

Here are my [dotfiles](https://github.com/MatteoGiorgi/dotfiles) and below a sample of my workflow ;)

## Computability & complexity notes

I know there is a vast bibliography on the subject but I just wanted to [write something](https://github.com/MatteoGiorgi/computability_and_complexity) intuitive and easy to read on such essential and extensive topic for a computer scientist.

The [notes](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/MatteoGiorgi/computability_and_complexity/blob/master/pp_tot.pdf) are written in italian and follow professor [P. Degano](http://pages.di.unipi.it/degano/) lectures at [*B.Sc. Computer Science*](https://didattica.di.unipi.it/en/undergraduate-programme-in-computer-science/) University of Pisa.




## Wiener attack

[Here](https://github.com/MatteoGiorgi/wiener_attack) I wrote a [brief paper](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/MatteoGiorgi/Wiener-Attack/blob/master/wiener_attack.pdf) regarding RSA protocol and the attack M.J. Wiener published in 1990. I tried to create a self-contained work, emphasising the power of playing with [continued fracions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continued_fraction) using *Legendre theorem*.

A simple implementation of the attack is included in the end using few lines of [*Wolfram Language*](https://www.wolfram.com/language/) ;)

## Asteroid++

Remember [Asteroids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asteroids_%28video_game%29), the one all the cool kids used to play with? [This](https://github.com/MatteoGiorgi/asteroids_plus_plus) is a replica (with few additions) of the 1979 Atari game written in JavaScript using [P5.js](https://p5js.org/) libraries.

[Play](https://matteogiorgi.github.io/asteroids_plus_plus/) using <kbd>w</kbd>, <kbd>a</kbd>, <kbd>d</kbd> to move around and <kbd>spc</kbd>, <kbd>m</kbd> to fire and drop bombs ;)
