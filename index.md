## My Linux config

I recently switched to [Qtile](http://www.qtile.org/) from good old [i3](https://i3wm.org/) and I felt right at home. Qtile has its source code and config file written in python, plus a neat [documentation](http://docs.qtile.org/en/latest) comes in support if you fancy to play with it ;)

Here are my [dotfiles](https://github.com/MatteoGiorgi/dotfiles) and below a sample of my workflow.

## Computability & complexity notes

I know there is a vast bibliography on the subject but I just wanted to write [something](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/MatteoGiorgi/computability_and_complexity/blob/master/pp_tot.pdf) intuitive and easy to read on such essential and extensive subject for a computer scientist. The notes are written in italian and follow professor [P. Degano](http://pages.di.unipi.it/degano/) lectures at Bsc [*Computer Science*](https://didattica.di.unipi.it/en/undergraduate-programme-in-computer-science/) University of Pisa.




## Wiener attack

[Here](https://github.com/MatteoGiorgi/wiener_attack) I wrote a [brief paper](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/MatteoGiorgi/Wiener-Attack/blob/master/wiener_attack.pdf) regarding RSA protocol and the attack M.J. Wiener published in 1990. I tried to create a self-contained work, emphasising the elegance of working with [continued fracions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continued_fraction) using *Legendre theorem*. In end I included a simple implementation of the attack in few lines of [*Wolfram Language*](https://www.wolfram.com/language/) ;)
