Remember [Asteroids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asteroids_%28video_game%29), the one all the cool kids used to play with? The original, released by Atari in 1979, was implemented by Rains, Logg, and Walsh on hardware developed by Delman and was a vector game, in which the graphics were composed of lines drawn on a vector monitor.

Well, a while back I decided to recreate this classic in JavaScript using [P5.js](https://p5js.org/) libraries and this is the result:

Feel free to play with it [here](https://matteogiorgi.github.io/asteroids/src) or in the window above using `w`, `a`, `d` to move around and `spc`, `m` to fire and drop bombs: yes, I've added bombs that activate themselves once launched, how cool is that!
