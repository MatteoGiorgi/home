I've used [Qtile](http://www.qtile.org) for a while and I can tell it's a good window manager; it has its source code and config file written in Python, plus a neat [documentation](http://docs.qtile.org/en/latest) comes in support if you fancy to play with it. The only problem imo is stability: in more than one occasion I had to deal with [issues](https://github.com/qtile/qtile/issues) appearing just because of last updates.

So I decided to change and I knew exactly what I wanted: my new window manager had to be dynamic (I like my windows layouts to be preconfigured just like in Qtile), had to integrate its own bar and a usable default config to start with (I didn't have much time for tinkering), plus It would be great if it had good documentation too.

The choices narrowed down to [dwm](https://dwm.suckless.org), [Xmonad](https://xmonad.org), [Awesome](https://awesomewm.org) and the latter seems perfect for the job: I am no Lua programmer but with no effort the wm is configured and it flies. Awesome!

These days I'm experimenting with other window managers but to have a rough idea on how this workflow works, feel free to browse through my [Awesome deadfiles](https://github.com/matteogiorgi/.deadfiles/tree/main/awesome/.config/awesome).
