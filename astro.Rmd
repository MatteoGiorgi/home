title: "Asteroids++"

Remember [Asteroids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asteroids_%28video_game%29), the one all the cool kids used to play with? The original, released by Atari in 1979, was implemented by Rains, Logg, and Walsh on hardware developed by Delman and was a vector game, in which the graphics were composed of lines drawn on a vector monitor.

This one is a replica (with few additions) and it is written in JavaScript using P5.js[^1] libraries; feel free to play with it in [fullscreen mode](https://matteogiorgi.github.io/asteroids_plus_plus/src) or just in the window below using `w`, `a`, `d` to move around and `spc`, `m` to fire and drop bombs.

[^1]: I really **do not like** to write in JavaScript but [P5.js](https://p5js.org/) has a good documentation and even an online editor, give it a chance.
