title: "My GNU/Linux config"

I recently switched to [Qtile](http://www.qtile.org/) from i3 and I felt right at home[^1]. Qtile has its source code and config file written in Python, plus a neat [documentation](http://docs.qtile.org/en/latest) comes in support if you fancy to play with it.

You can browse through my [dotfiles](https://github.com/MatteoGiorgi/.dotfiles) or just take a look at my workflow, there is a sample below.

[^1]: [i3](https://i3wm.org/) treats windows as if they are leaves in a n-ary tree and since the management is all manual the screen can get pretty messy very quickly. Qtile on the opposite keeps its windows in a stack and has predefined layout so the user doesn't has to manage anything, apart from choosing the layout he prefers best.
