title: "My GNU/Linux config"
---




I recently switched to [Qtile](http://www.qtile.org/) from good old [i3wm](https://i3wm.org/) and I felt right at home[^1]. Qtile has its source code and config file written in Python, plus a neat [documentation](http://docs.qtile.org/en/latest) comes in support if you fancy to play with it.

You can browse through my dotfiles or just take a look at my workflow, there is a sample below.

[^1]: You can find my old i3 config files in the repo too.
