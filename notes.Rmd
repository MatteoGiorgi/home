title: "Computability notes"
---




I know there is a vast bibliography on the subject but I just wanted to write something intuitive and easy to read on such essential and extensive topic for a computer scientist.

The notes are written in italian and follow professor [P. Degano](http://pages.di.unipi.it/degano/) lectures at [B.Sc. Computer Science](https://didattica.di.unipi.it/en/undergraduate-programme-in-computer-science/) University of Pisa. The source code can be compiled using R with Rmarkdown[^1] package, just use this tiny Rscript below.

```{r eval=FALSE}
#! /usr/bin/env Rscript

require(rmarkdown)
render(commandArgs(trailingOnly=TRUE))
```

Take a look at the notes in [fullscreen mode](https://matteogiorgi.github.io/computability_notes/src/notes.pdf) or just watch them in the window below. Stay tuned for the next updates.
