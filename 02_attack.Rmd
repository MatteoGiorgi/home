title: "Wiener attack"
---




Few years ago I wrote a [brief paper](https://github.com/MatteoGiorgi/wiener_attack) regarding RSA protocol and the attack M.J. Wiener published in 1990. I tried to create a self-contained work, emphasising the power of playing with [continued fractions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continued_fraction) using *Legendre theorem*. The attack states that under certain conditions[^1] the RSA module $N$ could be factorized in $\mathcal{O}\big(log_2(N)\big)$, let's take a peak on how it works using an example (in the paper you will find the same example implemented in Wolfram Mathematica).

Given the public key $(e,N)$ of an RSA cryptosystem with a small private exponent

$$(e,N) = (58549809,2447482909)$$

the expansion of $\frac{e}{N}$ and its convergents will be

$$\frac{e}{N} = \bigl[\,0;\,41,\,1,\,4,\,23,\,\dots\,\bigr]$$
$$\{ c_i \}_{i{\leq}15} = \biggl\{0,\,\frac{1}{41},\,\frac{1}{42},\,\frac{5}{209},\,\frac{116}{4849},\,\dots\biggr\}$$

Using the search algorithm derived from Wiener Theorem, we notice that the fourth convergent $c_3{=}\frac{5}{209}$ is the right candidate $\widetilde{\phi}$ for $\phi(N)$:

$$\biggl\lfloor \frac{e}{c_3} \biggr\rfloor = \biggl\lfloor \frac{58549809}{\frac{5}{209}} \biggr\rfloor = 2447382016$$

Now, $\widetilde{\phi}$ allow us to obtain $p{=}60317$, $q{=}40577$ prime factors of $N$.

[^1]: The sufficient condition for the attack to be effective concern the private exponent $d$:
$$d < \frac{N}{2\bigl(N{-}\phi(N)\bigr)g_0k_0}$$
such exponent will be simply called *small*.
